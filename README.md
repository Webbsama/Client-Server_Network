# Client-Server_Network

This software is supposed to be client-server network example.

I wanted to learn more about networking because I am working with it during my internship. I was hoping this would go more in-depth on what I was working on.

The coding language I picked for this project was python. 

# Useful Websites

These are the websites that I found useful while working on this project. Real Python was a tutorial for how to create a socket.
The socket was supposed to allow me to start on my client-server model. Geeks for Geeks was what really explained to me how a client-server model worked.
